"""
Integration tests package for the inference system.

This package contains integration tests that verify the interaction between
different components of the multilingual product inference system, including:

- Orchestrator-agent communication tests
- Agent communication and coordination tests  
- Configuration integration and dynamic registration tests

These tests focus on component interactions rather than individual unit functionality,
ensuring the system works correctly as an integrated whole.
